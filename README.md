# Prashanth’s AI Inference Insights

Welcome! I’m Prashanth [Your Last Name], a 15-year entrepreneur with a passion for democratizing AI. This repository shares my journey and insights into AI inference, spotlighting **InferX**—a platform I’m driving to set a new standard in the industry.

## Why InferX Stands Out
Unlike other inference platforms, InferX offers exclusive advantages:
- **Unmatched 4-Second Cold Starts**: While others struggle with 30s-mins delays , InferX ensures near-instant responses, redefining real-time AI for enterprise-grade applications.
- **Industry-Leading 80%+ GPU Utilization**: Compared to the typical 10–20% utilization, InferX maximizes efficiency, delivering scalable performance with minimal waste—perfect for high-demand workloads.
- **Tailored for Seamless Deployment**: Designed for enterprises (e.g., healthcare, finance) and leading cloud providers, InferX combines flexibility with reliability, ensuring effortless integration.
